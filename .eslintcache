I worked as a football journalist for Spain’s largest football website. I blogged for Spain’s largest broadsheet. I wrote interactive quizzes about Britain for the French company OpenAsk.com and translated a poem anthology so successfully that the writer told me he preferred my English versions of his poems to his Spanish ones!</p>\r\n                <p> I’m fascinated by what makes us tick. Why we make the decisions we do. I love copywriting because it’s a combination of writing and psychology. You can write the prettiest sentences in the word, but if you don’t understand your readers. And I mean really - what’s keeping them up at 3am - understand them.  If you don’t think like they think and speak like they speak then those pretty sentences aren’t worth the pixels they are printed on. Good copywriting is a combination of art, science and good old-fashioned hard work. I love nothing better than rolling my sleeves up and getting to grips with a new project.</p>\r\n                <p> If I'm not  then I’m probably cycling around Sussex trying desperately to beat my Strava records.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n       \r\n       </article>      \r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  export default About;\r\n  ","C:\\Users\\Isabel\\Desktop\\tomWebSite\\tomwebsite\\src\\components\\NavBar.js",["38","39","40","41","42"],"C:\\Users\\Isabel\\Desktop\\tomWebSite\\tomwebsite\\src\\components\\Contact.js",["43"],{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"45","line":6,"column":3,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":6,"endColumn":7},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"48","line":3,"column":20,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":3,"endColumn":26},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"49","line":4,"column":3,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":4,"endColumn":9},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"50","line":5,"column":3,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":5,"endColumn":8},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"45","line":6,"column":3,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":6,"endColumn":7},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"51","line":1,"column":8,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":1,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"52","severity":1,"message":"53","line":21,"column":15,"nodeType":"54","endLine":21,"endColumn":31},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"48","line":3,"column":22,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":3,"endColumn":28},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"49","line":4,"column":5,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":4,"endColumn":11},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"50","line":5,"column":5,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":5,"endColumn":10},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":25,"column":17,"nodeType":"54","endLine":25,"endColumn":50},{"ruleId":"55","severity":1,"message":"56","line":42,"column":23,"nodeType":"54","endLine":42,"endColumn":52},{"ruleId":"57","severity":1,"message":"58","line":9,"column":17,"nodeType":"54","endLine":9,"endColumn":94},"no-unused-vars","'Link' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","'Router' is defined but never used.","'Switch' is defined but never used.","'Route' is defined but never used.","'NavBar' is defined but never used.","jsx-a11y/alt-text","img elements must have an alt prop, either with meaningful text, or an empty string for decorative images.","JSXOpeningElement","jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid","The href attribute requires a valid value to be accessible.
